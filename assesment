1 what is  the difference between a module and a package?
2 explain the purpose of __init__.py
3 why should from module import * be avoided?
solution
1 a module is a python file that contains python functions variables and classes,etc that can be imported from a package
2 the __init__.py is a python file that is put into a directory and initializes it as a package,a package cant be recognized or imported from without it, it is also used to carry out
some functions or messages when an import is made from the package it is in e.g print package loading succcesful
3 the * imports all modules in a package and in some cases it can slow down or make the project heavier, and due to the fact that you dont now everything in the package you are importing
there might be naming conflicts with other modules or classes from the imported package and your current work
